                                        not social media messages. We will endeavour to make the alteration where
                                        possible dependant on the design and amount of notice given. We will let you
                                        know its effect on the price. Accepting any alterations is at the discretion of
                                        Estherfairs Cakes. Alterations must be made prior to 6 weeks before your event

                                        thoroughly before making payment.</p>

                                    <p>In an extremely rare situation, last minute design changes by us may need to be

                                        if circumstances beyond our control compromise the quality of the finished
                                        product. e.g. weather conditions. We will endeavour to keep any changes minimal
                                        but the client will be notified of any major design change and this will never
                                        be done without the client's prior permission.
